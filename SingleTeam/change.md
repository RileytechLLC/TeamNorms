# Responding to change
* Decompose deliverables into small pieces
* Deliver “partial” solutions
* Deliver flexible solution through technical excellence
* Recognize that code is disposable
* Choose to defer decisions over making uninformed decisions
  * Defer to the last responsible moment
* Plan Daily (or more often)

# Taking on implementation risk early
* Timebox an idea
* Action over Deliberation
* Pay down the debt now to save later
* Challenge old ways of working
* BDD the why
